In the side panel you will get a list with parts as planned, so you can choose one or more part IDs:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/traceability-foss/main/docs/src/images/arc42/user-guide/ess-investigation-part-selection.png[]

By clicking the second "Create ESS investigation" button, situated on the right side of this list, you will open a third panel, to choose or enter a BPNS.

==== Choosing the BPNS

In order to have a correct BPNS, this form offers a look-up for this, based on the company information, like name, location, street name, etc.

But also, if you are sure about it, you can enter the BPNS without searching for a company.

By clicking on the "Create" button you finalize the creation of the new investigation.

Every investigation has the "INITIAL" status. This is update based on subsequent IRS interrogations, based on the job ID assigned the investigation. This interrogation is done by a scheduled task, running in the backend. How often should this run, you can set by defining the ess.initialDelayForIrsJobStatusCheck environment variable.

=== Creating new investigation using the parts as planned list

You also can create such investigation using the parts as planned list.
