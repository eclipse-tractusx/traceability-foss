A table view split into the different BOM lifecycle phases (AsBuilt / AsPlanned) of a part. By default, both tables are displayed.
Adjustment of the view of tables can be done by activating/deactivating the fullscreen width of the tables.

Between the views, there is a slider to adjust the view to make either the left or the right table more visible.

Both tables can be sorted, filtered, and searched.

Pre-filtration buttons can be toggled to only show own/supplier/customer parts in the table.
The global search bar at the top returns part results from both tables.

Choosing the filter input field for any column and typing in any character will show filter suggestions.

Parts which exist in a quality notification will be highlighted as a yellow colored row in the parts table.

=== Parts selection -> Publish assets

Select one or multiple parts that are in the AsBuilt lifecycle. A button will appear on the right of the lifecycle view selection:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/traceability-foss/main/docs/src/images/user-manual/parts/publish_assets_button.svg[]

Selection will enable you to publish assets with the goal to persist them (import state "persistent").
With a click on the button a window will be opened, where the selected assets are displayed and a required policy must be selected:
