= Structure

Trace-X is divided into two components: Frontend and Backend.
It roughly can be broken down into the following parts:

* Asset controllers to get the asset information
* Dashboard controller to get dashboard related summed up information
* Registry controller to fetch assets from the Digital Twin Registry
* Notification controllers to get notification information and create edc notification offers
* Submodel controller for providing asset data functionality
* Import controller for importing trace-x data for data provisioning.
* Contract controller to get information about contract agreements
* EDC controller to retrieve notifications
* IRS Callback controller to retrieve asynchronous jobs completed by IRS.
* Policy controller to retrieve information about policies
* BPN controller to retrieve information about business partners

The backend does a request to the Digital Twin Registry utilizing the Registry controller. Extracted data from the response is made available through the Asset controller and the Dashboard controller to the Frontend.
