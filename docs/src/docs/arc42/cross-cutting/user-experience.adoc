=== Table design

Trace-X uses the following table design to build consistent and user-friendly tables:

|===
|Component |Description |Example

|Actions
a|* Black icons
* When an action cannot be executed for any reason, the icon turns grey
* A tooltip is shown when hovering over an executable action to describe it
* A tooltip is shown when hovering over a disabled action to describe the reason why it can't be executed
|image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/traceability-foss/main/docs/src/images/arc42/cross-cutting/user-experience/table-actions.png[]

|Action menus
a|* Opens when clicking on a three-dot menu
* Disappears, when clicking anywhere outside the menu
* List of action icons with text labels
* The three-dot menu is sticky when used inside the table for single-item actions

|Multi-select box
a|* Clicking on it when no items are selected, selects all items on the current page
* Clicking on it when some items are selected (but not all), selects all items on the current page
* Clicking on it when all items are selected, deselects all items on the current page
* Clicking on the small arrow opens a menu for clearing the page selection or the entire selection
* The menu disappears, when clicking anywhere outside the menu
* Part of the column header row -> Sticky on top next to column headers

|Selection box
a|* Clicking on it toggles item selection
|

|Selection count
a|* Shows selection count of the current page
|

|Column header
a|* Shows the column title
* Hovering over it shows a tooltip that describes sorting behaviour
* Clicking on it toggles sorting
* Sticky on top

Ascending sorting: image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/traceability-foss/main/docs/src/images/arc42/cross-cutting/user-experience/table-sorting-ascending.png[]
Descending sorting: image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/traceability-foss/main/docs/src/images/arc42/cross-cutting/user-experience/table-sorting-descending.png[]

|Filter
a|* Can search for any string
* Results are shown directly without having to press enter
* Results are shown as a sorted list (ascending)
* Selected results are shown on top of unselected ones
* The checkbox inside the search field selects or deselects every result
* The cross inside the search field resets the search and the filter
* When the filter is active, 'All' changes to the filtered value (+ the number of other filters)
* For date values, the search is replaced with a date picker
* Sticky on top below column headers

|Quick filter
a|* Used to quickly filter for specific values
* Independent of regular filters
* Work exclusively - only one filter can be selected at a time
* Click on the currently active quick filter to deactivate it
|

|Table column settings
a|* Opens up as an overlay
* Clicking on Save, the cross or anywhere outside the overlay will close the overlay (only saving changes when clicking Save)
* Selecting/deselecting columns makes them visible/invisible in the table
* The order of the columns can be changed by selecting the column title and using the arrow buttons
* Using the circle arrow icon resets the column visibility and column order
|image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/traceability-foss/main/docs/src/images/arc42/cross-cutting/user-experience/table-column-settings.png[]

|Full-width toggle
a|* Used to switch between full-width mode or variable-width mode
|

|Page size selector
a|* Shows the currently selected page size
* When clicking on it, a dropdown opens that shows available page size options
* Clicking any option will select that option and close the dropdown
* Clicking anywhere outside the dropdown closes the dropdown without applying any changes
* Three options are always available
|image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/traceability-foss/main/docs/src/images/arc42/cross-cutting/user-experience/table-page-size-selector.png[]

|Page information
a|* Shows information about the amount of items on the current page and the total amount of items
|

|Page controls
a|* Used to switch between pages
* Controls are: First page, previous page, next page, last page
* Hovering over the controls shows a tooltip that labels each control

In addition, following tables are used within Trace-X:

When the data is not as complex and/or extensive and single-item actions are not needed:

When data must only be shown and no actions are needed:
