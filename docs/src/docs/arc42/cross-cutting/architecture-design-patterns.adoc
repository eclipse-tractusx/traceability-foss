= Architecture and design patterns

== Module / Package structure

* Main domain name

** application
*** optional: subdomain name (in case of inheritance) â†’ following same structure as main domain
*** mapper: holds the mapper of transforming domain models to response models
*** service: holds the interface for implementation in the domain package
*** rest: holds the controller for providing the api for the domain
** domain
*** optional: subdomain name (in case of inheritance)
*** model: holds the domain model
*** service: Implementation of the interface provided in the application package
*** repository: holds the interface for accessing the infrastructure package
** infrastructure
*** optional: subdomain name (in case of inheritance)
*** model: holds the technical entities
*** repository: holds the data access layer
**** e.g. JPARepository / Impl
** All models (Request / Response) used in the API should be saved in the tx-model project.
To be reusable for cucumber testing.
