== Exception and error handling

There are two types of potential errors in TraceX:

=== Technical errors

Technical errors occur when there is a problem with the application itself, its configuration or directly connected infrastructure, e.g. the Postgres database.
Usually, the application cannot solve these problems by itself and requires some external support (manual work or automated recovery mechanisms, e.g. Kubernetes liveness probes).

These errors are printed mainly to the application log and are relevant for the healthchecks.

=== Functional errors

Functional errors occur when there is a problem with the data that is being processed or external systems are unavailable and data cannot be sent / fetched as required for the process.
While the system might not be able to provide the required function at that moment, it may work with a different dataset or as soon as the external systems recover.

=== Rules for exception handling

==== Throw or log, don't do both

When catching an exception, either log the exception and handle the problem or rethrow it, so it can be handled at a higher level of the code.
By doing both, an exception might be written to the log multiple times, which can be confusing.

==== Write own base exceptions for (internal) interfaces

By defining a common (checked) base exception for an interface, the caller is forced to handle potential errors, but can keep the logic simple.
On the other hand, you still have the possibility to derive various, meaningful exceptions for different error cases, which can then be thrown via the API.

Of course, when using only RuntimeExceptions, this is not necessary - but those can be overlooked quite easily, so be careful there.

==== Central fallback exception handler

There will always be some exception that cannot be handled inside of the code correctly - or it may just have been unforeseen.
A central fallback exception handler is required so all problems are visible in the log and the API always returns meaningful responses.
In some cases, this is as simple as a HTTP 500.

==== Dont expose too much exception details over API

It's good to inform the user, why their request did not work, but only if they can do something about it (HTTP 4xx).
So in case of application problems, you should not expose details of the problem to the caller.
This way, we avoid opening potential attack vectors.
