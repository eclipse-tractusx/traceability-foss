TraceX -> DTR: Query for aasIDs by bpn and digitalTwinType
DTR -> TraceX: Retrieve aasIDs
rnote right TraceX
BOMLifecycle Type (asBuilt/asPlanned) is filterable by api parameter of digitalTwinRegistry (parameterName: digitalTwinType)
Then for each BOMLifecycle Type we do two requests (upward/downward) to the IRS job API
end rnote
rnote right TraceX
Optimization: Trace-X uses  digitaltwinregistry.externalSubjectIdWildcardAllowedTypes = digitalTwinType in dtr query to detect bom lifecycle.
end rnote
TraceX -> IRS: Register order for parts to get semantic models and traversal aspects for all aasIds (e.g. 200.000)
rnote right TraceX
TraceX provides a callback url which will be requested by IRS once a batch of the previous registered order is completed.
This results in multiple callbacks until the full list of aasIDs has been processed by the IRS.
end rnote
TraceX <-- IRS: Receive callback request by IRS including order ID.
rnote right TraceX
Current state: TraceX extracts semantic models and traversal aspects and directly map and persists them into the database
end rnote
TraceX -> TraceX: Store jobIds completed into a separate database table and set status to JOB_COMPLETED
rnote right TraceX
Introducing states to manage data records (JOB_COMPLETED, PERSISTENCE_COMPLETED)
Sequential processing of data records and transitioning them to the correct status.
end rnote
TraceX -> IRS: Jobs within the order of irs will be requested when they have the state JOB_COMPLETED
IRS -> TraceX: Provide associated semantic models and traversal aspects
TraceX -> TraceX: Semantic models and traversal aspects will be extracted, mapped to parts and persisted into database.
TraceX -> TraceX: Update status of new data record table for the completed entry to PERSISTENCE_COMPLETED

rnote right TraceXFE
Expectation: This request assumes that all data processing in TraceX has been completed and the data is available.
end rnote
TraceXFE -> TraceX: Get parts
TraceX -> TraceXFE: List<Parts>
