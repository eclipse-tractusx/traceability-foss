Feature: ‚≠ê[BE] Include reason for receiver and sender investigations
	#*As a* Dev
	#
	#*I want to* update contract of:
	#
	#/investigations/created (sender side of notifications)
	#/investigations/received (receiver side of notifications)
	#
	#with following object:
	#{code:java}
	#{
	#  "reason" : {
	#    "close" : $string,
	#    "accept": $string, | nullable
	#    "decline": $string | nullable
	#  }
	#} {code}
	#Where for accept and decline reason, it's either one or another. Reasons are passed from receiver to sender and from sender to receiver via EDC and stored in the database.
	#
	#*so that* the information provided with the update is also stored and provided to sender and receiver sides.

	#Check if *CLOSURE* of quality investigations is processed correctly which contains following checks:
	#* correct CLOSE on receiver side
	#* correct reception of status update on sender side
	#* correct reason on receiver and sender side

	Scenario: [BE] Check correct processing of CLOSURE of quality investigation
		When I am logged into TRACE_X_A application
		When I use assets with ids 'urn:uuid:7eeeac86-7b69-444d-81e6-655d0f1513bd'
		And I create quality notification

		| "description" | "Testing CLOSURE TRACEFOSS-1861" |
		| "type" | "INVESTIGATION" |
		Then I check, if quality notification has proper values
		| "description" | "Testing CLOSURE TRACEFOSS-1861" |
		| "status"      | "CREATED"                           |
		When I approve quality notification
		Then I check, if quality notification has proper values
		| "status" | "SENT" |
		When I am logged into TRACE_X_B application
		Then I check, if quality notification has been received
		And I check, if quality notification has proper values
		| "status" | "RECEIVED" |
		When I acknowledge quality notification
		Then I check, if quality notification has proper values
		| "status" | "ACKNOWLEDGED" |

		When I am logged into TRACE_X_A application
		Then I check, if quality notification has proper values
		| "status" | "ACKNOWLEDGED" |
		When I close quality notification
		Then I check, if quality notification has proper values
		| "status" | "CLOSED" |

		When I am logged into TRACE_X_B application
		Then I check, if quality notification has proper values
		| "status" | "CLOSED" |

	#Check if *ACCEPTANCE* of quality investigations is processed correctly which contains following checks:
