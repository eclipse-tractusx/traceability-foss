  Scenario: [BE] Check correct processing of targetDate = null in quality investigation
    When I am logged into TRACE_X_A application
    When I use assets with ids 'urn:uuid:7eeeac86-7b69-444d-81e6-655d0f1513bd'
    And I create quality investigation
      | "severity"    | "MINOR"                                     |
      | "description" | "Testing without targetDate TRACEFOSS-1247" |
    Then I check, if quality investigation has proper values

      | "targetDate"  | ""                                          |
      | "status"      | "CREATED"                                   |
    When I approve quality investigation
    Then I check, if quality investigation has proper values
      | "status" | "SENT" |
    When I am logged into TRACE_X_B application
    Then I check, if quality investigation has been received
