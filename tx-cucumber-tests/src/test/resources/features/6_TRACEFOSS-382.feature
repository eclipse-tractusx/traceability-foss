	#h2. User story
	#As a user
	#
	#I want to be able to create a quality investigation for selected parts with a description of the defect
	#
	#to notify the corresponding supplier(s) of the parts about a possible quality issue that needs to be investigated. The requests should be stored in a queue with status pending and not be directly send to the supplier(s).
	#
	# 
	#
	#*Detailed description*
	#
	#The user can create a quality investigation for one or more parts. The description added in the pop up will be added to every part. Once the user creates a quality investigation he will get an information that there is one or more investigations pending for distribution.
	#The user can click on the information and will directy be redirected to pending Queue in his Quality investigation inbox.
	#

	#*Additional info*

	#* correct sending of several parts in *one* investigation
	#* correct reception of several parts in *one* investigation on receiver side
	#* correct update of *one* investigation with several parts
