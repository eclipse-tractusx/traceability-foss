Feature: ‚≠ê[BE] Include reason for receiver and sender investigations
	#*As a* Dev
	#
	#*I want to* update contract of:
	#
	#/investigations/created (sender side of notifications)
	#/investigations/received (receiver side of notifications)
	#
	#with following object:
	#{code:java}
	#{
	#  "reason" : {
	#    "close" : $string,
	#    "accept": $string, | nullable
	#    "decline": $string | nullable
	#  }
	#} {code}
	#Where for accept and decline reason, it's either one or another. Reasons are passed from receiver to sender and from sender to receiver via EDC and stored in the database.
	#
	#*so that* the information provided with the update is also stored and provided to sender and receiver sides.

	#Check if *CANCELLATION* of quality investigations is processed correctly which contains following checks:
	#* correct CANCELLATION on receiver side
	#* correct reception of status update on sender side
	#* correct reason on receiver and sender side
