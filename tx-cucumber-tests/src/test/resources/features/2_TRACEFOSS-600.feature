Feature: ⭐ [BE][QUALITY_ALERTS] Enable Quality Alerts
	#h2. User Story
	#
	#*As a* user
	#*I want to* be able to use all quality alerts
	#*so that* can report quality problems in upstream visibility.
	#h2. Outcome
	# * (x) Quality Alerts are implementd (HAPPY PATH)
	#
	#h2. Consolidation for pbis
	# * TRACEFOSS-1388
	#
	#h2. Sprint Planning 2
	# * Part 1 -> Pull Request 1
	# ** Make sure to not duplicate code instead of base class or reuse existing logic (e.g. state transitions)
	# ** Implement a service
	# ** Publisher Service
	# ** Receiver Service
	# ** Implement a repository
	# * Part 2 -> Pull Request 2 ( Do not start with it before PR 1 is merged)
	# ** Make sure all condiitions which exclude quality alerts are removed
	# ** Make sure that the existing api which creates a contract will be able to create it for quality alerts
	# *** /api/edc/notification/contract
	# ** Make sure that the logic of receiver side does filter for quality alert assets (currently only for quality investigations)
	# ** Send alert from a to b
	# ** Send alert from b to a
	# * Part 3 -> Pull Request 3 -> Enable frontend -> [~martin.maul@doubleslash.de] 
	# ** [https://github.com/catenax-ng/tx-traceability-foss/pull/264/files#diff-de4cfce80ee64138f3cdf6ab0af7b29aed8687212738a0a2d18567e29e7b9472R31]
